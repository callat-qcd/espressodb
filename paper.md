# Summary

Leadership computing facilities around the world support cutting-edge scientific
research across a broad spectrum of disciplines including understanding climate
change, combating opioid addiction, or simulating the decay of a neutron. While the
increase in computational power has allowed scientists to better evaluate the
underlying model, the size of these computational projects have grown to a point where
a framework is desired to facilitate with the management of the workflow. A typical
scientific computing workflow includes 1) defining all input parameters for every step
of the computation, 2) defining dependencies of computational tasks, 3) storing output
of tasks to disk, and 4) performing data analysis on output. ``EspressoDB`` is a
programmatic object-relational data management framework developed
to streamline this workflow, centeralize and guarentee data integrity, while providing
domain flexibility and remaining light weight.

``Gala`` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for ``Gala`` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. ``Gala`` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the ``Astropy`` package [@incite:2019] (``astropy.units`` and
``astropy.coordinates``).

``LatteDB`` a version of ``EspressoDB`` that is specialized to contain table definitions
for Lattice QCD calculations, is currently being used to manage the workflow of the 2019
INCITE project titled *The Proton's Structure and the Search for New Physics* [@incite:2019].
The corresponding website generated by ``LatteDB`` can be found at https://ithems.lbl.gov/lattedb/.
A precursor to ``EspressoDB`` and ``LatteDB`` was used to support a series of Lattice QCD projects
([@Nicholson:2018mwc], [@Chang:2018uxx], [@Berkowitz:2018gqe]). The framework provided by
``EspressoDB`` aims to support the ever increasing workflow of scientific computing at leadership
computing facilities, with the goal of giving scientists more time to focus on science.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$


# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
