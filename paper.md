# Summary

Leadership computing facilities around the world support cutting-edge scientific research across a broad spectrum of disciplines including understanding climate change [@Kurth_2018], combating opioid addiction [@Joubert:2018:AOE:3291656.3291732], or simulating the decay of a neutron [@Berkowitz:2018gqe].
While the increase in computational power has allowed scientists to better evaluate the
underlying model, the size of these computational projects have grown to a point where
a framework is desired to facilitate managing the workflow.
A typical scientific computing workflow includes:

1. Defining all input parameters for every step of the computation;
2. Defining dependencies of computational tasks;
3. Storing some of the output data to tape;
4. Post-processing these data files;
5. Performing data analysis on output.

[``EspressoDB``](https://github.com/callat-qcd/espressodb/) is a programmatic object-relational data management framework implemented in Python and based on the [``Django`` web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com).
``EspressoDB`` was developed to streamline data management workflows, centralize and guarantee data integrity, while providing domain flexibility and ease of use.
The [*Features* section](#features) summarizes ``EspressoDB``.

[``LatteDB``](https://github.com/callat-qcd/lattedb/), a version of ``EspressoDB`` <span style="color:red">[ANDRE: is it a version?  this does not seem like the correct description]</span> that is specialized to contain table definitions for Lattice QCD calculations, is currently being used to manage the workflow of the 2019 INCITE project titled *The Proton's Structure and the Search for New Physics* [@incite:2019]
and it will be used for the 2020 INCITE project titled *The Structure and Interactions of Nucleons from the Standard Model* [@incite:2020].
The corresponding website generated by ``LatteDB`` can be found at [https://ithems.lbl.gov/lattedb/](https://ithems.lbl.gov/lattedb/).
A precursor to ``EspressoDB`` and ``LatteDB`` was used to support a series of Lattice QCD projects
([@Nicholson:2018mwc], [@Chang:2018uxx]).
The framework provided by ``EspressoDB`` aims to support the ever increasing complexity of workflows of scientific computing at leadership computing facilities, with the goal of reducing the amount of human time required just to manage the jobs, thus giving scientists more time to focus on science.
The [*Use case* section](#use-case) presents how ``LatteDB`` is integrated in the INCITE project.

# Features

The main objective behind ``EspressoDB`` is to store vast amount of data
<span style="color:red">[ANDRE: this is not the correct goal.  The goal is to "simplify" the life of the users for managing the scientific computing.  To achieve this goal, EspressoDB must be able to store vast amounts of meta-data and data...]</span>
and provide an easy to use framework which help make fast and informed decisions.
The latter condition demands that it be possible to query the data and store relations between different datasets, e.g., an SQL based framework.
<span style="color:blue">More users are familiar with Python than SQL.  To maximize the accessibility of this framework,</span>
~~To ensure that this framework is accessible and users do not have to learn SQL to get started,~~
``EspressoDB`` <span style="color:blue">is written in Python and</span> makes use of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
E.g., instead of having a (file based) table system, tables correspond to Python classes and objects correspond to rows in this table.
Columns of such tables correspond to attributes of the objects.
Thus it is possible to filter for objects by their attributes or generate summary tables (``pandas.DataFrame``) within one line of code.
Furthermore, using an ORM allows to have the same interface independent of the backend.
It is possible to store data in a file based `SQLite` solution, or use more scalable options like `MySQL` or `Postgresql`.

``EspressoDB`` builds on top of Python's ``Django`` ORM framework.
``Django`` is part of many open-source projects and thus comes with extensive documentation.
Additionally, ``Django`` is scalable, comes with reliable tests and vast community support which manifests in the fact that it is commonly  used in large scale projects (BitBucket, Instagram, Mozilla, NASA and many more).
One guiding principle of ``EspressoDB`` is to stay close to it's roots and therefore leverage the support coming from ``Django``.
As a result, one can easily incorporate many of ``Django``'s extensions and find solutions to technical questions online.

Data integrity is important to scientific projects and becomes more challenging the larger the project.
In general, a SQL framework type-checks data before writing to the database and controls dependencies and relations between different tables to ensure internal consistency.
 ``EspressoDB`` implements an abstract ``Base`` classes which allows additional user-defined constraints not supported by SQL.
Once the user has specified a set of conditions entries have to fulfill for each table, ``EspressoDB`` runs these cross checks for new data before storing it.

Another aspect of ``EspressoDB`` is to support collaborative and open-data oriented projects.
For this, ``Django``'s web hosting component is utilized and extended.
In addition to providing a centralized data platform, it is possible to spawn[^1] customized web pages which can be viewed, on a local machine only, a local network or the world wide web.
On default, utilizing the ``Base`` classes, ``EspressoDB`` spawns

* documentation views of implemented tables,
* a project wide notification system,
* project specific Python interface guidelines which help writing scripts to populate the database and
* admin pages for interacting with data in a GUI.

Further views can be implemented to interact with data and can utilize existing Python libraries for summarizing and visualizing information on the fly---thus automating workflows and providing progress updates in real time.

It is possible to setup simple tables using ``EspressoDB`` and connect to these tables in existing projects within 10 minutes.
More details, usage instructions and examples are documented at [espressodb.readthedocs.io](https://espressodb.readthedocs.io).

[^1]: Depending on the configuration, it is possible to provide selected access for multiple users on different levels.


# Use case

> `@walkloud`, `@cchang5`: We need more verbosity here --- below you can find some ideas of what might fit.

* ``LatteDB`` is an example project which describes Lattice Quantum Chromo Dynamics computations and utilizes ``EspressoDB``.
* Computations are run on (several) remote machines.
* Such computations generate ~ 200TB distributed over ~ 400k files.
* Depending on machine availability and runtime information, it is not guaranteed that (a) files are generated in a predictable pattern, (b) all generated files are generated correctly (file size)
* To obtain physical results, these files need to be combined depending on their meta information.
* ``LatteDB`` is used to monitor the status, generate new jobs depending on the progress (missing files) and stored finished objects to tape.
