# Summary

Leadership computing facilities around the world support cutting-edge scientific research across a broad spectrum of disciplines including understanding climate change, combating opioid addiction, or simulating the decay of a neutron.
While the increase in computational power has allowed scientists to better evaluate the
underlying model, the size of these computational projects have grown to a point where
a framework is desired to facilitate with the management of the workflow.
A typical scientific computing workflow includes

1. defining all input parameters for every step of the computation,
2. defining dependencies of computational tasks
3. storing output of tasks to disk, and
4. performing data analysis on output.

``EspressoDB`` is a programmatic object-relational data management framework developed to streamline this workflow, centeralize and guarentee data integrity, while providing domain flexibility and remaining light weight.

``LatteDB`` a version of ``EspressoDB`` that is specialized to contain table definitions for Lattice QCD calculations, is currently being used to manage the workflow of the 2019 INCITE project titled *The Proton's Structure and the Search for New Physics* [@incite:2019].
The corresponding website generated by ``LatteDB`` can be found at https://ithems.lbl.gov/lattedb/.
A precursor to ``EspressoDB`` and ``LatteDB`` was used to support a series of Lattice QCD projects
([@Nicholson:2018mwc], [@Chang:2018uxx], [@Berkowitz:2018gqe]).
The framework provided by ``EspressoDB`` aims to support the ever increasing workflow of scientific computing at leadership computing facilities, with the goal of giving scientists more time to focus on science.
