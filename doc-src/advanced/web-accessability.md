# How to set up a server which can be seen by others

It is possible to [launch this app on an network accessible port](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2260745), e.g.,
```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
And now everyone in the network can access this page.

For a constantly up homepage, you should probably [configure an apache server using `mod_wsgi`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/) or [use external hosts like pythonanywhere.com](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/DeployExistingDjangoProject/).
